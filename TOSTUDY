    -- thread, - false paralellizm, single process jump from thread to thread
\/ Headers, Standart Libraies
    -- header can be just a declaration or header-only library with code
    -- header-only library interpreted as part of main program code
    -- there are 2 additional types of libraries: static and dynamic
    -- static are added to program at compile time (and they are present in executable)
    -- dynamic are added to program during runtime (smaller size executable, needs to be installed on other systems)
